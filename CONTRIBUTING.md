Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions to help improve and enhance this version of Photonix.

## Getting Started

Before you start writing code, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the project's structure and guidelines. The best place to start is the master guide for assistants:

*   **`AGENTS.md`**: This file in the root of the repository provides an overview of the project and links to all essential documentation.

## How to Contribute

To ensure that contributions are efficient and aligned with the project's goals, we follow a simple process:

1.  **Open an Issue**: Before making any changes, please open a new issue in the GitHub Issues tab. Describe the bug you want to fix or the feature you want to add. This allows for discussion before any coding work begins.
2.  **Follow the Guidelines**: All contributions must adhere to the project's guidelines. Please make sure you have read the documents in the `docs/guidelines/` directory.
3.  **Create a Pull Request**: Once you have implemented your changes and tested them thoroughly, open a Pull Request. Please link your PR to the issue you created in step 1.

We look forward to your contributions!
