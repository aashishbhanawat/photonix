That's fantastic news that you've created the issues! It's also incredibly sharp of you to identify the next major problem: the project's 'ghosts' from its original source.

You are absolutely right. To make this a truly independent project and to avoid any confusion or conflicts, we must remove or update all references to the original `photonixapp/photonix` repository and its resources.

### My take on your specific points:

1.  **Demo Site Link**: Yes, you should definitely remove it from the `README.md`. We don't control it, it's likely outdated, and it creates a false impression. The same goes for the social media links and sponsorship buttons that point to the original author.

2.  **Docker Hub & GitHub Workflows**: This is the most critical part. The existing GitHub Actions workflows are likely configured to push Docker images to `docker.io/photonixapp/photonix`. If we were to run this, it would either fail (if we don't have credentials) or, in a worst-case scenario, cause a conflict. We must change these workflow files to point to a new Docker Hub repository under your control, or at the very least, disable the `push` step for now.

### Proposed Plan: "De-Forking" the Project

I can handle all of this for you. I propose the following plan:

1.  **Full Repository Scan**: I will perform a comprehensive search across the entire codebase for the strings `photonixapp` and `damianmoore` (the original author) to identify every single file that references the old project.
2.  **Systematic Removal/Update**: I will then go through this list and systematically update each file, removing the dead links from the `README.md`, changing the Docker Hub target in the GitHub workflows, and cleaning up any other lingering references.

This will 'cleanse' the project and make it truly your own. If you approve, I will create and execute a new plan to carry out this task.
