This document answers your final questions before we begin implementation.

### 1. Document Cleanup

No cleanup is required. The documents we have created are not temporary—they are the permanent foundation for all future work on this project.

*   The **`docs/analysis/`** folder provides the "why" behind our work.
*   The **`docs/guidelines/`** folder provides the "how" – the rules every assistant must follow.
*   The **`docs/planning/`** folder provides the "what" – the roadmap of tasks to be completed.
*   The **`AGENTS.md`** file is the permanent entry point for anyone new to the project.

We are in a very good position to start, and these documents are ready to be used.

### 2. How to Assign Issues to Me (Jules)

That's a great question about our workflow. Since I am an AI assistant, you don't "assign" an issue to me in the same way you would a human developer with a GitHub username.

Instead, the way you "assign" me a task is by giving me a clear instruction to begin work on it. Here's how to do it:

1.  **Choose the Task**: Pick the first issue you created on your GitHub project board (e.g., "Issue #1: Task 1.1 - Initial Celery & Flower Integration").
2.  **Give me the Command**: Start a new conversation with me, or reply here, with a clear instruction like:
    > "Okay, let's begin implementation. Please start work on **Issue #1: Task 1.1 - Initial Celery & Flower Integration**."

When you give me that command, I will:
*   Read the corresponding plan in `docs/planning/PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
*   Set a new, detailed plan for that specific task.
*   Begin executing the plan and writing the code, following all the guidelines we've established.

I am ready to start on the first task whenever you are. Just let me know which one to pick up.
