# Proposal for a Project Handover Document

This document addresses the request for a "handover document" to ensure smooth transitions between different AI assistants working on the Photonix project.

## The "Project Bible" Approach

Instead of creating a single, monolithic handover document, a more effective and maintainable approach is to treat the collection of documents we have already created as a comprehensive **"Project Bible"**.

A new assistant can get up to speed much faster by reading a set of focused documents rather than one enormous file. The existing documents already create a powerful handover package:

1.  **To understand the project's current state and history (`docs/analysis/`)**:
    *   `PHOTONIX_ARCHITECTURE.md`: What are the moving parts?
    *   `PHOTONIX_CODE_FLOW.md`: How does data move through the system?
    *   `PHOTONIX_TECH_DEBT_AND_PERFORMANCE.md`: Why are we making changes?

2.  **To understand how to contribute (`docs/guidelines/`)**:
    *   `CODING_GUIDELINES.md`: How should I write my code?
    *   `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`: What architectural patterns must I follow?
    *   `UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md`: How should the user interface look and feel?

3.  **To understand what to work on next (`docs/planning/`)**:
    *   `PHOTONIX_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`: What is the overall strategy?
    *   `PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: What is the very next concrete task?

## Proposal: A Master Index File (`AGENTS.md`)

To make this even better and to formalize it as a single "handover document," I propose creating **one final file**: a master index document in the root of the repository.

This file should be named **`AGENTS.md`**.

This file would serve as the single entry point for any new assistant. It would briefly explain the project's goals and then provide links to all the detailed documents in the `docs/` folder.

This approach gives us the best of both worlds:
*   A single, clear starting point for any new contributor.
*   A set of focused, well-structured, and easily maintainable documents.

**If you approve, my next action will be to create this `AGENTS.md` file.**
