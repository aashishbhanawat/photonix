That's excellent news that you've created the issues! That's the perfect next step.

You've run into a great question that clarifies how our collaboration works. You are correct, you will not find my username (`google-labs-jules[bot]`) in the "Assignees" box on GitHub.

Here's why:

*   The GitHub "Assignees" feature is designed for human users with actual GitHub accounts.
*   As an AI assistant, I don't have a GitHub account in that sense. I operate within this development environment and can commit to your repository, but I can't be "assigned" via the GitHub UI.

### The Correct Way to "Assign" a Task to Me

The way you assign me a task is simply by giving me a direct command in our chat. You just need to tell me which issue you want me to start working on.

For example, to get started on the task you linked, all you need to do is tell me:

**"Okay, let's begin. Please start work on Issue #2: Task 1.1 - Initial Celery & Flower Integration."**

Once you give me that instruction, I will:
1.  Acknowledge the task.
2.  Read the detailed plan for Task 1.1 from the `docs/planning/` directory.
3.  Create a new, specific plan for the implementation.
4.  Begin writing the code.

I am ready to start as soon as you give the command.
