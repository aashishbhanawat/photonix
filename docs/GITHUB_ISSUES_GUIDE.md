# How to Enable the "Issues" Tab on a Forked GitHub Repository

It's a very common situation on GitHub that the "Issues" tab is disabled by default when you fork a project. Here are the simple steps to enable it for your own use.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Navigate to Your Fork**: Go to the main page of your forked repository on the GitHub website.

2.  **Open Settings**: Click on the **Settings** tab. It's usually located on the far right of the navigation bar, next to "Actions" and "Projects".

3.  **Find the Features Section**: On the "General" settings page that loads by default, scroll down until you see the **"Features"** section.

4.  **Enable Issues**: In the list of features, you will see **Issues** with a checkbox next to it. The box will be unchecked. **Click the checkbox to enable it.**
